# Mysql2::Instrumentation

This gem provides OpenTracing autoinstrumentation for [Mysql2](https://github.com/brianmario/mysql2).

## Supported versions

- MRI Ruby 2.0 and newer
- Mysql2 0.5.0 and newer

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mysql2-instrumentation'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install mysql2-instrumentation

## Usage

Before creating a new Mysql2 client, add this code:

```ruby
require 'mysql2/instrumentation'

Mysql2::Instrumentation.instrument(tracer: tracer)
```

`instrument` takes an optional parameter, `:tracer`, which sets the OpenTracing
tracer to use. If one is not provided, the `OpenTracing.global_tracer` is used.
